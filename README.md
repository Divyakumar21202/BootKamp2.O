## Known Issues

- Main Activity Student Information Display: Currently, the MainActivity does not display information related to the student who is already registered and logged in.
  This is a feature that we are actively working on and will be implemented in an upcoming update.
- The upcoming update will ensure that logged-in students can view their personal information and relevant details within the MainActivity.

## Future Enhancements

- Enhanced Student Information Display: As part of our ongoing development efforts, we are dedicated to improving the MainActivity experience. We plan to enhance the student information display to provide logged-in users with a comprehensive view of their academic data, achievements, and other relevant information.
- This feature will allow students to conveniently access their personal records and stay informed about their academic journey.
- **Recycler View**: A recycler view will be added to display student data more efficiently.
- **Additional Features**: We're actively working on introducing more features to make your experience even better.
